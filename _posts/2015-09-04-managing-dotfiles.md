For some time now I have been looking for a way to manage my config files,
    so-called dotfiles.

This post details managing dotfiles using vcsh, myrepos and github.

These tools allow us:  
- Have separated repos for each 
- Automatize a new configuration in a new computer
- Manage all repos at the same time

**Set-up the environment**
