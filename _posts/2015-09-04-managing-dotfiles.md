For some time now I have been looking for a way to manage my config files, the
so-called dotfiles.

This post details managing dotfiles using vcsh, myrepos and github.

These tools allow us:  

- Have the configuration files in separated repos
- An automated way to loading dotfiles on a new machine
- Manage different repos at the same time
